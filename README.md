Objective: 
The objective of this project is to analyze sales trends by category, subcategory, product, region, and customer demographics to identify gaps and address them to boost revenue. 

Insights and Recommendations:
•	Year over year, revenue has increased and crossed the $1 million threshold in 2021, and it is set to cross $2 million in 2022.

•	The top-selling product in terms of order quantity is water bottles; however, the most revenue-generating products are mountain and road bikes, with 95% of revenue coming from bikes.

•	Overall profitability is showing an upward trend; however, it is key to focus on the hero product, which is the wide range of road and mountain bikes, to drive more revenue and profitability.

•	The majority of customers come to the store to purchase bikes and associated accessories and clothing, such as water bottles and shorts. My recommendation here is to start selling bikes for children because, on average, each customer has 1.84 children.

•	Since August 2021, revenue per customer has declined, while the total number of customers has increased. If we compare bike sales in 2021 with those in 2022, we can see that bike sales have increased by a small percentage. However, the sales of accessories have increased significantly, indicating that sales of expensive products such as bikes are rising. My recommendation is for the company to focus on selling more bikes, which will indirectly boost the sales of accessories and clothing products.

•	Male and female customers are equally represented at 50% each, so actual stock and safety stock should be kept in equal proportion. The majority of customers come from average- and low-income groups, so the key recommendation here is to focus 88% of bike stock within the affordable price range, with the remaining 12% targeting high-income groups with more expensive bikes.

•	According to the current trend, the product sourcing strategy and product cost are working in favor of the business because profit margins are good, and the company is not burning cash. The cost of buying products and the pricing strategy are effective, and the company should continue with this strategy.

•	The company should introduce a few strategies to acquire and retain customers, such as implementing a points card for customer loyalty and offering discounted products to repeat customers.
